## PO Status Request

The Purchase Order Status Request document, POStatusRequest-v2015.1.xml, requests from the supplier the status of an outstanding Purchase Order. In fact, the status of multiple Purchase Orders may be requested in one transaction, thus obviating the need for multiple requests. This document is in beta testing as of this writing.
