## Party Document

The Party document, Party-v2009.1.xml, contains general information about the parties involved in the B2B transactions that the parties wish to share with each other. Each party, also called a trading partner, creates a Party document.

The Party document contains public identifying information about one trading partner. However, for added flexibility, multiple trading locations for the partner may be specified in the same document. These locations might be such things as different branch offices, product warehouses, or shipping destinations. Each party and each location includes a unique ID, which may be in GLN (Global Location Number) or NAMM format, plus the partner entityâ€™s name, address, phone, email, and other contact information.
