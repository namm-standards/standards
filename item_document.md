## Item Document

The Item document, Item-v2015.1.xml, essentially contains a catalog of items available for sale. The supplier creates this document and provides it to prospective buyers.

The Item document structure is reasonably “flat”, presenting salable items in a simple hierarchy with few levels. Each item has many possible descriptive characteristics, most of which are optional, but which provide ease of description for virtually any product, including packaging, origin, and warranty information.
