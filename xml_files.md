## XML Files

### Usage Note
Below are descriptions and discussions of the XML documents currently defined by the NAMM standard. Note that, as with any XML implementation, these files merely define the structure of the data and do not require nor support any specific processing agents (i.e., application software). The responsibility for creating, validating, transmitting, receiving, and parsing the files and their content therefore rests solely with the business entities (suppliers and buyers) using them. To facilitate validation, each XML document has an accompanying file that contains the document's specific, clearly defined rules, called an XSD schema; see “XML Schemas”.
