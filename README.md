#Introduction

This repository is intended as a conceptual and practical guide to NAMMâ€™s Business-to-Business (B2B) XML data exchange standard, and specifically a reference to the XML files defined by the standard.

#Audience

The target audience for this document is the technical team in a musical products merchandising company whose responsibility includes internal software management, configuration, and integration, especially as relates to interfacing with external data sources. These companies may supply musical products, consume them, or both.

#Overview

In the course of providing musical products from one company to another, certain data must be exchanged between suppliers and buyers. While the specific software systems of each company will necessarily differ in platform, connectivity, and functionality, it is highly advantageous to both parties that the structure of the data exchanged be consistent from transaction to transaction. It is this need for structural consistency that is addressed and provided by the NAMM B2B standard.
