## Sell Through

The Sell Through document, SellThrough-v2012.1.xml, is an optional post-transaction report sent by the buyer to the supplier, indicating what products have been sold, to which locations, for what price, etc. This document is discretionary and informational only, and thus does not trigger any further action, acknowledgement, or event.
