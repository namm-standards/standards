## Purchase Order

The Purchase Order document, PO_v2015.1.xml, contains a list of items the buyer has selected for purchase from the supplier.

The Purchase Order document first provides basic information about the proposed sale, such as buyer, billing, and supplier data. It then provides overall sale specifics, such as terms and shipping instructions. Finally, it provides a shipping location and a list of ordered items.
