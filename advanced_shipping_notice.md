## Advanced Shipping Notice

The Advanced Shipping Notice document, ASN_v2015.1.xml, contains detailed information about one or more orders in progress from supplier to buyer. It may be requested via the Purchase Order document, and provides specific partial or full order shipment details, enabling the buyer to reconcile items ordered with those actually received.
