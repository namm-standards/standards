## Price Book

The Price Book document, Pricebook-v2015.1.xml, contains pricing information for various items offered by the supplier. It can specify price changes (breaks) at different purchase tiers (e.g., 1-100 units, 101-500 units, etc.) as well as indicate units of measure (UOM) for the tiers.

This document is optional, and is in beta testing as of this writing.
